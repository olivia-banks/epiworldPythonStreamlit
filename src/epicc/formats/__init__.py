"""
Tools for working with parameter files in heterogeneous formats. This module provides a common
interface for reading parameter files into a standardized dictionary format that can be used
by the rest of the application, as well as writing.

Supported formats are denoted in _LOADERS.

The rationale behind this abstraction is that, in order to support both effective serialization,
non-technical epidemiologists, and more technical users, we want to allow for multiple file
formats. For example, YAML files are more human-friendly and support nested structures, while
XLSX files are more familiar to epis who already work in spreadsheets and may find it easier to
organize parameters in that format.
